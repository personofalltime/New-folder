# Reinvent-The-Wheel

Welcome to the project that everybody was asking for, but didn't know they were asking for!

This tool allows you to convert an image into gcode commands that will let you print a 2-dimensional, black and white (or rather, whatever-colour-marker-you-choose and white!) image on paper, or any surface that you deem worthy of the image!

1. Just set the filepath in the main.py file to the path to whatever image you want to print, and wait for the 'output.gcode' file to pop up!.
2. Then, zip-tie (or more permanently secure, should you wish) a marker to your hotend (in the gap in front of a BLTouch if present) and press print on the GCode file!

Enjoy your beautifully inefficient image!
